## Milestone 4: Pre-Training Completion & SVR Breakthrough
**Status:** Pre-training Concluded / Ready for RLAIF

### Summary of Findings:
The implementation of the Hybrid Loss (Optimal Transport MSE + Categorical Cross-Entropy) successfully resolved the Continuous/Discrete Representation Gap. The DiT was deployed on a 400-epoch, 3-Phase Curriculum to scale the topological routing up to massive 128-node graphs.

At Epoch 343, the model achieved a monumental breakthrough: **100.00% Syntactic Validity Rate (SVR)** on the 128-node validation batch. 

### Key Architectural Validations:
*   **The Judicial Constraint Solver:** Replaced naive probability thresholding with mathematically rigid Top-K arity snapping and logit-weighted branch conflict resolution. This proved essential in translating the continuous DiT heat-map into flawlessly executable, acyclic matrices.
*   **Dynamic Gradient Accumulation & Checkpointing:** The $O(N^2)$ VRAM explosion caused by the Axial Attention blocks processing $128 \times 128$ matrices was successfully mitigated without losing gradient stability.

### Next Immediate Technical Step:
The continuous Flow Matching loss definitively plateaued at ~0.135. The model has extracted maximum topological value from the passive continuous objective. Training was terminated early at Epoch 350 to conserve compute.

1.  **RLAIF Implementation:** Utilize the epoch 340 checkpoint to begin the Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning phase.
2.  **Dense Reward Structure:** Deploy PPO to actively punish the network for generating topological errors (e.g. orphans or dead-end terminal sinks) using the `GraphValidator` rules as a direct reward signal. Includes a KL Divergence Anchor to prevent mode-collapse.
