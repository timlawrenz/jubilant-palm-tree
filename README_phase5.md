# Phase 5 - Aligning Text and Code Embeddings

**Goal**: Train a text-encoder so that the embedding it produces for a method's description is located at the same point in the 64-dimensional space as the embedding our GNN produces for the method's AST.

## Overview

Phase 5 represents the planned but not yet implemented phase of the project. This phase would focus on creating multimodal embeddings that align natural language descriptions of Ruby methods with their structural AST representations, enabling text-to-code and code-to-text generation capabilities.

## Planned Architecture

### Multimodal Embedding Alignment
The proposed architecture would extend the successful autoencoder from Phase 4 with a text encoder component:

```
Text Description → Text Encoder → 64D Embedding
                                      ↓ (Alignment Loss)
Ruby AST → GNN Encoder (frozen) → 64D Embedding
```

### Key Components (Planned)
- **Text Encoder**: Transformer-based encoder (BERT/RoBERTa) for method descriptions
- **Embedding Alignment**: Contrastive learning to align text and code embeddings
- **Shared Embedding Space**: 64-dimensional space from Phase 4 as target
- **Frozen GNN**: Preserve learned AST representations from previous phases

## Planned Implementation Strategy

### 1. Dataset Enhancement
- **Method Descriptions**: Extract or generate natural language descriptions for Ruby methods
- **Documentation Mining**: Harvest method docstrings and comments from source repositories
- **Synthetic Descriptions**: Generate descriptions using existing code-to-text models
- **Pairing Validation**: Ensure high-quality text-code pairs for training

### 2. Text Encoder Development
- **Architecture Selection**: BERT, RoBERTa, or CodeBERT as base text encoder
- **Fine-tuning Strategy**: Adapt pre-trained language model for code descriptions
- **Embedding Projection**: Linear layer to map text features to 64D space
- **Tokenization**: Handle code-specific terminology and Ruby syntax in descriptions

### 3. Alignment Training
- **Contrastive Loss**: Pull together matching text-code pairs, push apart non-matches
- **Hard Negative Mining**: Select challenging negative examples for robust training
- **Temperature Scaling**: Optimize contrastive learning temperature parameter
- **Batch Composition**: Balance positive and negative pairs in training batches

### 4. Evaluation Framework
- **Retrieval Tasks**: Text-to-code and code-to-text similarity search
- **Generation Quality**: Use frozen decoder from Phase 4 for text-to-code generation
- **Semantic Similarity**: Measure alignment quality in embedding space
- **Human Evaluation**: Assess naturalness of generated descriptions and code

## Expected Capabilities

### Text-to-Code Generation
```
Input: "A method that calculates the total sum of array elements"
↓ Text Encoder
64D Embedding
↓ AST Decoder (from Phase 4)
Ruby AST
↓ Pretty Printer
Output: def calculate_sum(array)
          array.sum
        end
```

### Code-to-Text Generation
```
Input: Ruby method AST
↓ GNN Encoder (frozen from Phase 4)
64D Embedding
↓ Text Decoder (new)
Output: "Calculates the total sum of array elements"
```

### Similarity Search
- **Find Similar Code**: Given a text description, find structurally similar methods
- **Find Descriptions**: Given code, find methods with similar functionality
- **Semantic Clustering**: Group methods by functional similarity rather than structural similarity

## Planned Technical Challenges

### 1. Data Quality
- **Description Quality**: Ensuring high-quality, accurate method descriptions
- **Semantic Alignment**: Matching natural language concepts to code structure
- **Vocabulary Gap**: Bridging domain-specific programming terminology

### 2. Architecture Design
- **Embedding Dimension**: Determining if 64D is sufficient for multimodal alignment
- **Encoder Capacity**: Balancing text encoder complexity with alignment quality
- **Training Stability**: Ensuring stable contrastive learning convergence

### 3. Evaluation Methodology
- **Metric Selection**: Defining appropriate metrics for text-code alignment quality
- **Benchmark Creation**: Establishing evaluation datasets for multimodal code tasks
- **Human Validation**: Designing human evaluation protocols for generated content

## Potential Applications

### Developer Productivity Tools
- **Intelligent Code Search**: Natural language queries for code repositories
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatic method description generation
- **Code Completion**: Context-aware suggestions based on natural language intent
- **Refactoring Assistance**: Suggest improvements based on description-code alignment

### Research Applications
- **Code Understanding**: Analyze how natural language relates to program structure
- **Cross-Language Transfer**: Extend methodology to other programming languages
- **Educational Tools**: Help developers understand code through natural language explanations

- ✅ **Trained GNN encoder** producing 64D embeddings (Phase 2)
- ✅ **Validated embedding quality** through complexity prediction (Phase 3)
- ✅ **Proven generative capability** through AST reconstruction (Phase 4)

The project is well-positioned to proceed with Phase 5 implementation, with all technical prerequisites successfully completed and validated.

## Next Steps
