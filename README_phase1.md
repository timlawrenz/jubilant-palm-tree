# Phase 1 - Data Generation & Preprocessing

**Goal**: To create a comprehensive dataset of Ruby methods with their Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and complexity metrics, ready for machine learning training.

## Overview

Phase 1 focused on building a complete data collection and preprocessing pipeline for Ruby code analysis. This phase established the foundation dataset by extracting thousands of Ruby methods from high-quality open-source repositories, processing their ASTs, calculating complexity metrics, and creating machine learning-ready datasets.

## Phase 1 Issues Completed

### Data Collection and Extraction
#### Repository Aggregation (`scripts/01_clone_repos.sh`)
- Automated cloning of 8 high-quality Ruby repositories
- Target repositories: Rails, Sinatra, Forem, Mastodon, Discourse, Fastlane, Spree, Liquid
- Robust error handling and idempotent operation
- Repositories stored in excluded `./repos/` directory

#### Method Extraction (`scripts/02_extract_methods.rb`)
- Comprehensive Ruby method extraction using the `parser` gem
- Recursive scanning of all `.rb` files in cloned repositories
- AST-based method detection (both instance `:def` and class `:defs` methods)
- Structured JSON output with method metadata: repository name, file path, line numbers, raw source code
- Successfully tested on real repositories (2,437+ methods extracted from 291+ files)

### Data Processing and Analysis

#### AST Processing & Complexity Analysis (`scripts/03_process_methods.rb`)
- Comprehensive AST analysis using Ruby parser gem
- Cyclomatic complexity calculation for each extracted method
- Enhanced data structure with JSON-serialized AST representations
- Output to structured JSONL format in `./output/processed_methods.jsonl`

#### Dataset Assembly & Cleaning (`scripts/04_assemble_dataset.rb`)
- Final dataset filtering by complexity range (2.0 ≤ complexity ≤ 100.0)
- Removal of edge cases: too simple (<2.0) or too complex (>100.0) methods
- Unique UUID assignment to each method entry
- Automated train/validation/test splitting (80/10/10)
- Clean JSONL output files ready for machine learning training
- Final dataset: 1,896 methods from 2,437 original extractions (77.8% retention)

### Infrastructure and Documentation
#### Project Infrastructure
- Comprehensive documentation with methodology explanation
- Proper `.gitignore` configuration excluding cloned repositories
- Complete dataset pipeline from source code to ML-ready format

## Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline
```
Ruby Repositories → Method Extraction → AST Processing → Dataset Assembly
     (8 repos)    →    (2,437 methods)  →   (complexity)  →  (1,896 final)
```

### Ruby Dependencies
- `parser` gem for AST processing and analysis
- `json` gem for data serialization
- Ruby 2.7+ for modern language feature support

### Data Quality Measures
- **Complexity Filtering**: Removed methods with complexity <2.0 or >100.0
- **AST Validation**: Ensured all methods have valid, parseable AST representations  
- **Metadata Integrity**: Complete source attribution and line number tracking
- **UUID Assignment**: Unique identification for every method sample

## Results Achieved

### Data Quality Metrics

- **Source Repositories**: 8 high-quality Ruby codebases

## Next Steps to Phase 2

Phase 1 successfully established the Ruby method dataset foundation. The processed data (`dataset/*.jsonl`) is ready for:

1. **Graph Conversion**: Transform AST JSON into PyTorch Geometric graph objects
2. **Feature Engineering**: Convert Ruby AST node types to numerical features

4. **Model Development**: Build Graph Neural Network architecture for complexity prediction

## Technical Dependencies

- `json` gem for data serialization

### Tools Used
- Git for repository management and cloning
- Shell scripting for automation
- JSON/JSONL for structured data storage

## Usage

```bash
# Install Ruby dependencies
bundle install

# Execute complete data pipeline
./scripts/01_clone_repos.sh
ruby scripts/02_extract_methods.rb  
ruby scripts/03_process_methods.rb
