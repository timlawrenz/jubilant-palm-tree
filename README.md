# jubilant-palm-tree

## Overview

This project explores the potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to understand and generate Ruby code through Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis. The project demonstrates that neural networks can learn meaningful structural representations of code complexity and successfully reconstruct AST structures from learned embeddings.

## Project Results Summary

âœ… **Complete Success**: Successfully demonstrated that GNNs can both predict Ruby code complexity and reconstruct AST structures from learned embeddings.

### Key Achievements
- **Superior Performance**: GNN model achieved MAE of 4.27 vs heuristic baseline of 4.46 (4.3% improvement)
- **Perfect Reconstruction**: 100% structural preservation in AST reconstruction across all test samples
- **Meaningful Embeddings**: 64-dimensional representations cluster methods by complexity and enable full code reconstruction
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: 1,896 Ruby methods from 8 high-quality open-source projects
- **Complete Pipeline**: End-to-end system from Ruby source code to embeddings to reconstructed code

### [Phase 5 - Aligning Text and Code Embeddings](README_phase5.md) ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**
**Goal**: Train a text-encoder so that the embedding it produces for a method's description is located at the same point in the 64-dimensional space as the embedding our GNN produces for the method's AST.
