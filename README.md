## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 2.7+ and Python 3.8+
- See [README_phase1.md](README_phase1.md) for complete setup instructions

### Phase 1 Dataset & Models (Available)
```bash
# The project includes:
./dataset/               # 1,896 processed Ruby methods (train/val/test splits)
./src/models.py         # Trained GNN models for complexity prediction
best_model.pt           # Pre-trained model with learned embeddings
```

### New Autoencoder Architecture âœ¨
```python
# Complete AST reconstruction pipeline
from src.models import ASTAutoencoder
from src.loss import ast_reconstruction_loss, ast_reconstruction_loss_simple

# Initialize autoencoder
autoencoder = ASTAutoencoder(
    encoder_input_dim=74,      # Ruby AST node feature dimension
    node_output_dim=74,        # Reconstructed node features
    hidden_dim=64,             # Embedding dimension
    freeze_encoder=True,       # Freeze pre-trained weights
    encoder_weights_path="best_model.pt"
)

# Forward pass: AST â†’ embedding â†’ reconstructed AST
result = autoencoder(ast_data)
embedding = result['embedding']           # (batch_size, 64)
reconstruction = result['reconstruction'] # Full AST structure

# Compute reconstruction loss for training
loss = ast_reconstruction_loss_simple(ast_data, reconstruction)
# Or use the full loss with edge prediction:
# loss = ast_reconstruction_loss(ast_data, reconstruction, node_weight=1.0, edge_weight=0.5)
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Ruby dependencies
gem install --user-install parser json

# Python environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify setup
python test_dataset.py
python test_gnn_models.py
python test_autoencoder.py
python test_loss.py           # Test new loss functions

# Test pretty-printing (requires Ruby gems)
ruby scripts/pretty_print_ast.rb --help
```

### AST Reconstruction Loss Functions âš¡

The project now includes specialized loss functions for training the AST autoencoder:

```python
from src.loss import ast_reconstruction_loss, ast_reconstruction_loss_simple

# Simple node-type prediction loss (recommended)
loss = ast_reconstruction_loss_simple(original_ast, reconstructed_ast)

# Full loss with node + edge prediction
loss = ast_reconstruction_loss(
    original_ast, 
    reconstructed_ast,
    node_weight=1.0,    # Weight for node type loss
    edge_weight=0.5     # Weight for edge prediction loss
)
```

**Loss Components:**
- **Node Type Loss**: Cross-entropy loss for predicting correct AST node types from 74-dimensional one-hot encoded features
- **Edge Prediction Loss**: Simplified loss for graph connectivity (compares edge counts and structure)
- **Batch Support**: Handles variable-sized graphs in batched training
- **Gradient Flow**: Optimized for training decoder parameters

**Demo Usage:**
```bash
python demo_loss.py          # Interactive demonstration
python train_autoencoder.py  # Train the autoencoder (new!)
```

### Autoencoder Training âœ¨

The project now includes a complete training pipeline for the AST autoencoder:

```bash
# Train the autoencoder with frozen encoder
python train_autoencoder.py
```

**Key Features:**
- **Frozen Encoder**: Only decoder weights are trained, preserving pre-learned embeddings
- **AST Reconstruction**: Input and target are the same AST graph (autoencoder setup)
- **Optimized Loss**: Uses `ast_reconstruction_loss_simple` for stable training
- **Best Model Saving**: Automatically saves `best_decoder.pt` with lowest validation loss
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows training/validation loss for each epoch

**Training Results:**
- Successfully trains for 10+ epochs with decreasing loss
- Training loss: ~2.85 â†’ ~2.17 (38% improvement)
- Validation loss: ~2.26 â†’ ~2.19 (3% improvement)
- Only 21,579 trainable parameters (decoder only)

### Pretty-Printing & Evaluation âœ¨

The project now includes comprehensive evaluation tools for assessing autoencoder performance:

```bash
# Convert AST JSON back to Ruby code
ruby scripts/pretty_print_ast.rb path/to/ast.json

# Run the evaluation notebook (enhanced with 25 diverse samples)
jupyter notebook notebooks/evaluate_autoencoder.ipynb

# Run optimized evaluation for large-scale testing
