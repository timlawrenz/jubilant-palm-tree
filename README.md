## Overview

This project explores the potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to understand and generate Ruby code through Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis.

**Current Phase**: Building a GNN-based decoder that can reconstruct a Ruby method's AST from learned embeddings, validating the generative potential of structural code representations.

## Phase 1 Results (Completed)

âœ… **Successfully demonstrated that GNNs can predict Ruby code complexity**
- Trained GNN model achieved MAE of 4.27 (beating heuristic baseline of 4.46)
- Learned meaningful 64-dimensional embeddings that cluster methods by complexity
- Complete dataset of 1,896 Ruby methods from 8 open-source projects
- Full documentation available in [README_phase1.md](README_phase1.md)

## Phase 2 Goals (Current)

ðŸŽ¯ **GNN-based AST Decoder Development** âœ…
- âœ… Built ASTAutoencoder that combines existing RubyComplexityGNN (encoder) with new ASTDecoder
- âœ… Encoder can extract meaningful 64-dimensional embeddings from Ruby method ASTs
- âœ… Decoder reconstructs AST structure from embeddings with configurable target nodes
- âœ… Complete forward pass: AST_in â†’ embedding â†’ AST_out implemented and tested
- âœ… Support for frozen encoder weights to preserve pre-trained representations
- ðŸ”„ Training pipeline for autoencoder optimization (future work)
- ðŸ”„ Advanced metrics for AST reconstruction quality (future work)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 2.7+ and Python 3.8+
- See [README_phase1.md](README_phase1.md) for complete setup instructions

### Phase 1 Dataset & Models (Available)
```bash
# The project includes:
./dataset/               # 1,896 processed Ruby methods (train/val/test splits)
./src/models.py         # Trained GNN models for complexity prediction
best_model.pt           # Pre-trained model with learned embeddings
```

### New Autoencoder Architecture âœ¨
```python
# Complete AST reconstruction pipeline
from src.models import ASTAutoencoder

# Initialize autoencoder
autoencoder = ASTAutoencoder(
    encoder_input_dim=74,      # Ruby AST node feature dimension
    node_output_dim=74,        # Reconstructed node features
    hidden_dim=64,             # Embedding dimension
    freeze_encoder=True,       # Freeze pre-trained weights
    encoder_weights_path="best_model.pt"
)

# Forward pass: AST â†’ embedding â†’ reconstructed AST
result = autoencoder(ast_data)
embedding = result['embedding']           # (batch_size, 64)
reconstruction = result['reconstruction'] # Full AST structure
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Ruby dependencies
bundle install

# Python environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify setup
python test_dataset.py
python test_gnn_models.py
```

## Next Steps

1. **Decoder Architecture Design**: Design GNN decoder that maps embeddings to AST structure
2. **Training Pipeline**: Implement training loop for embedding â†’ AST reconstruction
3. **Validation Metrics**: Develop metrics for AST reconstruction accuracy
4. **Code Generation**: Validate that reconstructed ASTs produce syntactically correct Ruby code
